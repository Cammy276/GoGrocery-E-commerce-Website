    <h1>Return & Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      At GoGrocery, we strive to ensure that our customers are satisfied with their purchases. 
      This Return & Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which you may request a return, 
      replacement, or refund. By shopping with us, you agree to the terms below.
    </p>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <div class="tnc-card">
        <h3>1. Eligibility for Returns</h3>
        <p>
          Not all products are eligible for return due to the nature of grocery and perishable items. 
          Returns are only accepted under the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Products delivered are damaged, defective, or spoiled upon arrival.</li>
          <li>Incorrect items were delivered (different from what was ordered).</li>
          <li>Non-perishable items (e.g., household goods) are unused, unopened, and in original packaging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Perishable goods such as fresh produce, chilled or frozen items, and bakery products are not returnable 
          unless they are damaged, expired, or spoiled upon delivery.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tnc-card">
        <h3>2. Reporting a Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Customers must inspect their orders immediately upon delivery. Any issues such as missing, damaged, or 
          incorrect products should be reported to our customer service team within <strong>24 hours</strong> 
          of delivery. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof of the issue (clear photos or videos) may be required to validate the claim before a replacement 
          or refund can be processed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tnc-card">
        <h3>3. Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          Once your request has been reviewed and approved, refunds will be processed in one of the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Store Credit:</strong> Credited to your GoGrocery account for future purchases.</li>
          <li><strong>Original Payment Method:</strong> Returned to your bank account, e-wallet, or card (processing time 
              may vary depending on payment provider, usually 5–14 working days).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Refunds are issued only for the value of the affected item(s). Delivery fees are generally non-refundable 
          unless the entire order was defective or canceled due to GoGrocery’s error.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tnc-card">
        <h3>4. Replacements</h3>
        <p>
          Where possible, GoGrocery may offer a replacement for items that are defective, damaged, or missing. 
          Replacements will be subject to stock availability and delivery schedules. If a replacement cannot be 
          provided, a refund or store credit will be issued instead.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tnc-card">
        <h3>5. Non-Refundable & Non-Returnable Items</h3>
        <p>
          Certain items cannot be returned or refunded, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fresh produce, chilled, frozen, or baked items (unless defective at delivery).</li>
          <li>Items purchased during clearance or special promotions marked as “non-refundable.”</li>
          <li>Products that have been opened, used, or tampered with after delivery.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="tnc-card">
        <h3>6. Failed Deliveries & Cancellations</h3>
        <p>
          If an order could not be delivered due to incorrect address, absence of the recipient, or refusal to accept 
          the order without valid reason, the order may be canceled and delivery fees will not be refunded. 
          Additional charges may apply for re-delivery requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellations requested by customers before dispatch may be eligible for full or partial refunds, 
          depending on the status of the order at the time of request.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tnc-card">
        <h3>7. Processing Time</h3>
        <p>
          All approved refunds and replacements will be processed as quickly as possible. Refunds to original payment 
          methods may take longer due to bank or payment provider processing times. GoGrocery will not be responsible 
          for delays caused by third-party financial institutions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tnc-card">
